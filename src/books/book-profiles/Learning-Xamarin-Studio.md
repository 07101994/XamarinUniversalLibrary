# Learning Xamarin Studio

## E-book blurb

Xamarin Studio is the premier cross-platform development tool for .NET. Using this Xamarin 3 IDE, you can create high-performance native applications for iOS, Android, and Mac using the same .NET features and tools you are already familiar and comfortable with.

Often the most frustrating part of beginning to work with a new tool or workflow is the process of simply getting started. Whether you are brand new to .NET development, or a veteran of the framework, Learning Xamarin Studio will help you get your cross-platform development environment up and running smoothly and quickly. Starting with selecting the right Xamarin license for you and your organization, this book will cover how to install Xamarin Studio, integrate the necessary third-party tools, explain the features and tools provided by the IDE, and walk through developing, testing, and deploying applications.
