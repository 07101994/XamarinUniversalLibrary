# Xamarin Unleashed

## E-book blurb

Xamarin Unleashed is the first comprehensive guide to using the Xamarin 3 toolset, C#, and .NET to develop native apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. 

Using the best-practice MVVM pattern, you'll learn how to write C# apps which can access all the APIs and hardware facilities provided by each top mobile platform, ensuring a truly native, state-of-the-art user experience while maximizing the amount of code you can share across platforms. 

You'll discover how to make the most of Xamarin's mature and robust toolset, and how to integrate it with the new Visual Studio 2015 to further accelerate your cross-platform development processes. 

Drawing on nearly 20 years of experience with enterprise mobile apps across the entire development lifecycle, Alec Tucker presents comprehensive, equal coverage of iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, from start to completion, with detailed sections on testing, profiling and monitoring, and an extensive library of downloadable source code examples. 

Along the way, he also shows how to make the most of powerful Xamarin tools ranging from Xamarin.UITest and TestCloud for test-driven development to Xamarin Insights for mobile analytics.
