# Cross-Platform Localization for Native Mobile Apps with Xamarin

## E-book blurb

This book is intended to teach you all aspects of Xamarin.Forms necessary to build a multilingual mobile application that runs on Android, iOS, and Windows platforms, and handle the localization and internationalization on each platform. You’ll learn how the Xamarin platform helps you build native apps using a single shared set of language resources in the .NET Framework, and how to tailor your apps to compete in the global market. You’ll also learn how to test applications for localization support and to avoid common pitfalls. Using Xamarin.Forms and Visual Studio, the sample app constructed is implemented for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 UWP, with 99% of the code shared across the platforms.
